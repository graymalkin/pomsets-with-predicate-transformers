allow (r1 = 1 && r2 = 1 && r3 = 1) [] "Allowed. A compiler could determine that the only legal values for x are 0 and 1. From that, the compiler could deduce that r3 != 0 implies r3 = 1.  A compiler could then determine that at r1 = x in thread 1, is must be legal for to read x and see the value 1. Changing r1 = x to r1 = 1 would allow y = r1 to be transformed to y = 1 and performed earlier, resulting in the behavior in question"
