allow (r1 = 42 && r2 = 42 && r3 = 42) [] "Allowed. A compiler could determine that the only legal values for x are 0 and 42. From that, the compiler could deduce that r3 != 0 implies r3 = 42.  A compiler could then determine that at r1 = x in thread 1, is must be legal for to read x and see the value 42. Changing r1 = x to r1 = 42 would allow y = r1 to be transformed to y = 42 and performed earlier, resulting in the behavior in question"
